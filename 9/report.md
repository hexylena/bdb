# Classroom Management

<!--o what did you generally notice about your classroom management? What do you see that works?-->

My classroom is overall fantastic, I have essentially zero issues with misbehaviour or disruptive behaviour. They're all adults by this point in their career, they know what's expected of them, and they're starting to understand the independence that's expected of them in the workplace. What really works for me is treating them like adults and holding them to the same standards I'm held to in meetings I attend; if I want my camera off it stays off, if my back-to-back meetings mean I need to eat then I do with mic and camera off.

# Intervention: Repeating

<!--o what do you see yourself doing in terms of interventions?-->

Per feedback from students I now work to repeat instructions multiple times, and call out which instructions I'm giving solely for their edification, and which they need to follow themselves.

# Effects on students

<!--o what effect do you think your interventions have on the students | o how do you think your interventions happen to the students?-->
<!--o which (e) point (s) of feedback have you actually included in this lesson?-->

Students seem to be responding well to this, but it's a relatively minor intervention and difficult to analyse effectively. I included the above mentioned intervention in the associated recorded lesson (timepoint, `25:40`, `31:15`, `33:40`), as it was easy carry out. However, it's more difficult to say what impact the students, other than hopefully an improvement for those students who were struggling to distinguish an activity they should do very a demonstration.

# Lessons Learned

I think the key point I've realised from this exercise is that I need my students to communicate better with me when I'm:

- going too fast
- not explaining something well enough
- not mentioning a demo, versus something they need to follow

All of these points are really the same point, the students are in smaller or larger ways, missing something, and not communicating that with me. I've tried to survey that, how can I make it more comfortable for them to do that, but the response was consistently that they wouldn't feel comfortable being the only one saying that. Reporting anonymously would work, but Teams hasn't offered any convenient way to do that. This was a bit better during in-person teaching when I could see their faces, but surely distance learning must have an equivalent option which requires more research or technological development to support continuous anonymous feedback. Using forms is an option, they're anonymous and public, but they take effort to setup and it's not clear if they can be automated.

# Tips & Tops & the future

The intervention went successfully, it was a relatively small intervention but still has a positive impact on students as it they were highly given feedback during Assignment 8. For tips, I still need to work on slowing down, I still talk too quickly for some students I think, an artefact of being a native english speaker. I don't have good ways to tackle that other than having an external person remind me occasionally or having students remind me, but they do not like to volunteer this feedback, so, it is as of yet unsolved. I think a few of them compensate by ignoring my lectures and watching the recordings which they can watch at any speed.
