# Classroom Management

<!--o what did you generally notice about your classroom management? What do you see that works?-->

My classroom is overall fantastic, I have essentially zero issues with misbehaviour or disruptive behaviour. They're all adults by this point in their career, they know what's expected of them, and they're starting to understand the independence that's expected of them in the workplace. What really works for me is treating them like adults and holding them to the same standards I'm held to in meetings I attend; if I want my camera off it stays off, if my back-to-back meetings mean I need to eat then I do with mic and camera off.

# Intervention(s)

<!--o what do you see yourself doing in terms of interventions?-->

## Picking

I notice in general my students are very quiet and non-responsive when prompted with general questions like "what did everyone think?"
they need to be called on by name to feel guilty enough to respond. I don't like how that feels, I didn't when I was a student, and it feels bad to do it now, but I see why teachers do, it's effective. No one is volunteering so calling on them instead.

## Repeating

Per feedback from students I now work to repeat instructions multiple times, and call out which instructions I'm giving solely for their edification, and which they need to follow themselves.

# Effects on students

<!--o what effect do you think your interventions have on the students | o how do you think your interventions happen to the students?-->
<!--o which (e) point (s) of feedback have you actually included in this lesson?-->

Students seem to be responding well to this, but they're both relatively minor inteverntions and difficult to analyse effectively. I included both mentioned above in the associated recorded lesson, as they're both easy to carry out. For the 'picking' intervention it is easier to say: students were more responsive. For the repeating intervention it's more difficult to say what impact the students.

# Lessons Learned

<!--o what did you learn with regard to competence teaching?-->
<!--o what did you learn with regard to the competence?-->

# Tips & Tops & the future

The intervention went successfully, it was a relatively small intervention but still has a positive impact on students as it they were highly given feedback during Assignment 8. For tips, I still need to work on slowing down, I still talk too quickly for some students I think, an artefact of being a native english speaker. I don't have good ways to tackle that other than having an external person remind me occasionally or having students remind me, but they do not like to volunteer this feedback, so, it is as of yet unsolved. I think a few of them compensate by ignoring my lectures and watching the recordings which they can watch at any speed.




Assignment
On the basis of feedback obtained so far on your teacher behavior, choose one or two things that you want to change / process in a lesson. Take this lesson, look it back and answer the questions.

Approach
1. You received feedback on your teaching from the lesson visits, the practical 'start of the lesson' and the intervision meetings. Choose one or two parts, which you will consciously change / improve in a lesson.
2. Record this lesson. The lesson is supposed to be an interactive lesson, so no lecture. Leave the camera running during the whole lesson, from the beginning to the end. Make sure you are in good view and that both you and the students are well understood.
3. Review the lesson and answer the questions described in the assessment criteria. When referring to fragmentss from the lesson, state the exact moment in the lesson (number of minutes).
4. Include both the recording and the answers in your portfolio.

Time
You need an average of 6 hours to complete this assignment.

Assessment criteria
• Both the lesson recording (via a link to MyMedia, https://mymedia.avans.nl/home) and the report are included in the portfolio. • The report on the lesson recording answers the following questions:
