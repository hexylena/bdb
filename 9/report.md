# Classroom Management

My classroom is overall fantastic, I have essentially zero issues with misbehaviour or disruptive behaviour. They're all adults by this point in their career, they know what's expected of them, and they're starting to understand the independence that's expected of them in the workplace.

# Interventions

I notice in general my students are very quiet and non-responsive when prompted with general questions like "what did everyone think?"
they need to be called on by name to feel guilty enough to respond. I don't like how that feels, I didn't when I was a student, and it feels bad to do it now, but I see why teachers do, it's effective. No one is volunteering so calling on them instead.



o what did you generally notice about your classroom management? What do you see that works?
o what do you see yourself doing in terms of interventions?
o how do you think your interventions happen to the students?
o which (e) point (s) of feedback have you actually included in this lesson?
o what did you learn with regard to competence teaching?
o what did you learn with regard to the competence?
o what would you give yourself for tops? o what would you give yourself for tips?
o what are you going to tackle and how are you going to do that?





Assignment
On the basis of feedback obtained so far on your teacher behavior, choose one or two things that you want to change / process in a lesson. Take this lesson, look it back and answer the questions.

Approach
1. You received feedback on your teaching from the lesson visits, the practical 'start of the lesson' and the intervision meetings. Choose one or two parts, which you will consciously change / improve in a lesson.
2. Record this lesson. The lesson is supposed to be an interactive lesson, so no lecture. Leave the camera running during the whole lesson, from the beginning to the end. Make sure you are in good view and that both you and the students are well understood.
3. Review the lesson and answer the questions described in the assessment criteria. When referring to fragmentss from the lesson, state the exact moment in the lesson (number of minutes).
4. Include both the recording and the answers in your portfolio.
