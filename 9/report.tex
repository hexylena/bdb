\section{Classroom Management}\label{classroom-management}}

My classroom is overall fantastic, I have essentially zero issues with
misbehaviour or disruptive behaviour. They're all adults by this point
in their career, they know what's expected of them, and they're starting
to understand the independence that's expected of them in the workplace.
What really works for me is treating them like adults and holding them
to the same standards I'm held to in meetings I attend; if I want my
camera off it stays off, if my back-to-back meetings mean I need to eat
then I do with mic and camera off.

\hypertarget{intervention-repeating}{%
\section{Intervention: Repeating}\label{intervention-repeating}}

Per feedback from students I now work to repeat instructions multiple
times, and call out which instructions I'm giving solely for their
edification, and which they need to follow themselves.

\hypertarget{effects-on-students}{%
\section{Effects on students}\label{effects-on-students}}

Students seem to be responding well to this, but it's a relatively minor
intervention and difficult to analyse effectively. I included the above
mentioned intervention in the associated recorded lesson (timepoint,
\texttt{25:40}, \texttt{31:15}, \texttt{33:40}), as it was easy carry
out. However, it's more difficult to say what impact the students, other
than hopefully an improvement for those students who were struggling to
distinguish an activity they should do very a demonstration.

\hypertarget{lessons-learned}{%
\section{Lessons Learned}\label{lessons-learned}}

I think the key point I've realised from this exercise is that I need my
students to communicate better with me when I'm:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  going too fast
\item
  not explaining something well enough
\item
  not mentioning a demo, versus something they need to follow
\end{itemize}

All of these points are really the same point, the students are in
smaller or larger ways, missing something, and not communicating that
with me. I've tried to survey that, how can I make it more comfortable
for them to do that, but the response was consistently that they
wouldn't feel comfortable being the only one saying that. Reporting
anonymously would work, but Teams hasn't offered any convenient way to
do that. This was a bit better during in-person teaching when I could
see their faces, but surely distance learning must have an equivalent
option which requires more research or technological development to
support continuous anonymous feedback. Using forms is an option, they're
anonymous and public, but they take effort to setup and it's not clear
if they can be automated.

\hypertarget{tips-tops-the-future}{%
\section{Tips \& Tops \& the future}\label{tips-tops-the-future}}

The intervention went successfully, it was a relatively small
intervention but still has a positive impact on students as it they were
highly given feedback during Assignment 8. For tips, I still need to
work on slowing down, I still talk too quickly for some students I
think, an artefact of being a native english speaker. I don't have good
ways to tackle that other than having an external person remind me
occasionally or having students remind me, but they do not like to
volunteer this feedback, so, it is as of yet unsolved. I think a few of
them compensate by ignoring my lectures and watching the recordings
which they can watch at any speed.
