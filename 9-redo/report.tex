\title[A9 - Video Re-recording]{Assignment 9 - Video Re-recording}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\noindent\rule{5in}{0.4pt}


I hereby submit an updated version of Assignment 9.

\textbf{This assignment is in three parts}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A short response to an assessor feedback, \textbf{which is important
  in the context of the resit video}
\item
  \textbf{The body of the report} (``Classroom Management'' below)
\item
  A second response to an assessor feedback, which is less important,
  but I feel strongly about.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{0.5pt}\end{center}

\begin{quote}
\emph{Feedback: Wherever I look in the recording, there is no
interaction whatsoever. Students might as well not exist in this
lesson.}
\end{quote}

I worry that this assessor has potentially missed the breakout rooms
which are unfortunately invisible in these videos. I think if it had
been a traditional classroom, I might not have received this comment, as
there \emph{is} significant interaction, but it's not necessarily
present on video.

Please consider that in the lengthy breakout rooms, students are taking
20-30 minute periods to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  work together to solve challenging problems
\item
  collaborate and discuss
\item
  determine and implement solutions
\item
  teach each other, when one is stronger and \emph{vice versa} learning
  from the other student(s) when they are weaker in this area
\end{itemize}

Here we have a significant amount of student interaction. Additionally I
am often ``walking'' around the breakout rooms to check in on students,
discuss, and answer their questions. All activities which are
\emph{invisible on the recording}, to the assessor. However since I
unfortunately missed to make separate additional recordings of my time
in the breakout rooms and splice those in with video editing software,
this was not present in the final product for a review that might be
skipping through the lesson observing a minute here and a minute there.

\emph{Additionally} to further address assessor concerns, I've added

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a kahoot at the start to recap the last lesson
\item
  and homework question period
\item
  and did a Microsoft Form in chat to determine how long their homework
  took.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{classroom-management}{%
\section{Classroom Management}\label{classroom-management}}

Overall the classroom is fine, I have essentially zero issues with
misbehaviour or disruptive behaviour. They're all adults by this point
in their career, they know what's expected of them, and they're starting
to understand the independence that's expected of them in the workplace.
What really works for me is treating them like adults and holding them
to the same standards I'm held to in meetings I attend; if I want my
camera off it stays off, if my back-to-back meetings mean I need to eat
then I do with mic and camera off. Additionally it is important to note
that this classroom is a \emph{subset} of the interactions I have with
these students, but by only submitting the classroom recording as
evidence, a very limited picture is given of relationships with students
and out of class interactions. I am regularly in communication with them
via email, teams, and other meetings which provide for different
interaction modalities.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{both.png}
\caption{\textbf{Left} the teacher interface to fastcups, a bar shows
the distribution of student responses. Below is the number of students
responding to the poll. \textbf{Right} is the student interface to
fastcups, here a student enters a URL provided by the teacher, and then
indicates their feelings. Red for ``I'm struggling!'', yellow for ``I
could use more repetition'', and green for ``It's all good!''. The
teacher interface is updated in real time based on student
responses.\label{fig1}}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{intervention-fastcups}{%
\section{Intervention: FastCups}\label{intervention-fastcups}}

Per feedback from the assessors who \emph{rightly} point out the lack of
student feedback, I've sought out other methodologies. I absolutely
agree that it is vital to understand how students are feeling about a
topic and if they are successfully keeping up with the material.

To that end, I've introduced the use of
\href{http://cups.fast.ai/}{fastcups} (\cref{fig1}), which mimics a
technique I had previously used in in-person programming classes. There
we used post-it notes (sticky notes), and would have students swap them
out based on how they were feeling. Red for ``I'm struggling!'', yellow
for ``I could use more repetition'', and green for ``It's all good!''

This methodology works exceedingly well, and better than relying on
facial expressions for a significant number of sub-cases. As an
instructor I am not familiar with all of the variance in cultural
differences of my students, what individual facial expressions mean for
one student may mean a completely different thing for another, based on
background/cultural differences/etc.

As a teacher I wanted to monitor this constantly during, and would use
this to compare student feelings before and after a step (\cref{fig2})

\begin{figure}
\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{bad-better.png}
\caption{Here we see a before and after explanation screenshot of the
fastcups interface, where it goes from bad to better, after deeper
explanation of a topic. Some red remains, interestingly, given how well
students did on the recap quiz, which may reflect other factors or
anxieties that are affecting their in-class feelings. However this is a
``foreign language'' they need to learn which requires significant
amounts of repetition of every phrase and grammar before they
comprehend.\label{fig2}}
\end{figure}

Thus letting students self report their feelings of the class provides
significantly better data than making a guess based off of their
appearance!

\hypertarget{effects-on-students}{%
\section{Effects on students}\label{effects-on-students}}

Students were much more able to communicate their feelings back to me as
a teacher, and the addition of the anonymity allows them to be more
honest in their reviewing \citep{Van_Zant_2014}. When the teacher view
of the tool was on screen, students could see the responses of their
classmates (in aggregate) and feel more comfortable in not being the
only person feeling behind or needing more explanation.

As a teacher I was really pleased with the effect of the tool (see
\cref{fig3}); I could

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Ask students ``please update fast cups, how do you feel?''
\item
  See the result trend towards yellow and red
\item
  Then slow down and re-explain the topic
\item
  Ask again
\item
  And see more green.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{pre.png}
\caption{Another screenshot of fastcups, shown next to the lesson
material, the above screenshot is ``before'' a deeper explanation is
needed, and the below is ``after'' the explanation is given and we see a
significant decrease in yellow responses as students increase
comprehension. Unfortunately there is still some red, but as this is a
``foreign language'' class, students will likely need to complete the
homework before they feel confident in themselves with the new
constructs they've learned today.\label{fig3}}
\end{figure}

This really quick interaction turnaround time produced a more efficient
classroom (e.g.~timepoints 39:00 - 41:38 / 2:23:55 - 2:29:18) I'm not
waiting for students to unmute and respond in front of their classmates,
they're able to tell me instantaneously, with no loss of privacy. And
for me as a teacher, that instantaneous feedback is invaluable,
especially since it is provided in a way that does not disrupt the flow
of the lesson.

\hypertarget{lessons-learned}{%
\section{Lessons Learned}\label{lessons-learned}}

If I am to continue in my preferred modality, and even if not (given
inability to read faces with any accuracy, as a new teacher), I should
absolutely be employing this tool consistently throughout my classes to
get feedback from students on how they are experiencing the class. I
think this gave students significantly more options for interaction
throughout the lesson in ways that work for them, based on Assignment 8.
Additionally given the context of the type of person attracted towards a
computer science based curriculum and their learning preferences, versus
say the type in a business course, this methodology meshes well with the
students.

\hypertarget{tips-tops-the-future}{%
\section{Tips \& Tops \& the future}\label{tips-tops-the-future}}

Top: Seeing student responses go from yellow and red to green (and some
yellow) following an explanation was a great feeling, and gave me
significant confidence in the methodology, that I could react so quickly
to their feelings. Additionally having the student responses on screen
occasionally, combined with anonymity, perhaps gave them more confidence
in answering that they were having difficulties. It is common across
teaching, I believe, for students to feel alone in being slow or behind,
when in fact everyone is, and it only becomes apparent during
discussions.

Tip: During the course I developed a concern for low response rate, that
perhaps students were not actively updating their ``cups'', and in a
future revision I will explore implementing a ``clear'' function, to
allow deleting their responses and then requesting them freshly, to make
sure the majority of students are responding. Additionally I should make
sure that the interface is always visible so I can appear to be more
responsive to it. I was watching my phone with the interface, but, this
may not have been apparent to students.

\hypertarget{assessor-feedback-discussion}{%
\section{Assessor Feedback
Discussion}\label{assessor-feedback-discussion}}

I specifically wish to address the following, because I worry the
assessor is not up to date on the equity and inclusion issues present

\begin{quote}
\emph{Feedback: But if you give students the freedom to hide behind a
closed camera, it can have negative consequences for your students and
for you. It's not good for their bonding with you and their peers. And
it's not good for their engagement in class. And it offers you less
insight into your students and therefore less feeling about whether what
you do with it, does land with them.}
\end{quote}

The potentially resulting cyberbullying, racism, and ableism, lead me to
consciously make different choices, which I discuss below. I understand
the reason for the criticism, but disagree with the solution, \textbf{I
think we can find alternatives that are better, like my proposed
fastcups.}

\hypertarget{hypothetical}{%
\subsection{Hypothetical}\label{hypothetical}}

Consider first the \emph{Gedankenexperiment}:

\begin{quote}
If seeing students is of such paramount importance, then we should
\textbf{immediately} fire blind and visually impaired teachers, as they
cannot be effective as teachers.
\end{quote}

This I think is obviously the wrong answer, and demands that we search
for alternative, inclusive solutions, as blind and visually impaired
teachers (or those deciding not to demand cameras) can absolutely still
be effective \citep{afzal2021sighted}!

\hypertarget{home-invasion}{%
\subsection{Home Invasion}\label{home-invasion}}

Requiring that cameras be on risks intruding into the personal lives of
students' homes (or lack thereof), putting learners education second and
their personal lives front and center, on display for their fellow
students. This risks highlighting disparities between students. Many
students do not have the luxury of a ``blank'' space they can show, and
the constantly visible cameras may be distracting or even voyeuristic
\citep{reed_2020, ng2020communicative} thus intruding into their
personal lives and opening the doors for cyberbullying from their peers.

I personally have a pride flag hanging in one room, this feels like
unnecessary oversharing of my personal life with students. However,
\emph{because} I am \emph{privileged}, and between my partner and I, we
have a flat with multiple rooms, I am able to find a less distracting
and personal background from which to teach. This does not necessarily
apply to students who may not have much choice or time to hide their
personality before a teacher demands cameras.

Virtual backgrounds are a common retort here, but they are inconsistent,
and not available across all platforms. Until recently, Zoom required
chromakeying (a greenscreen, with extra cost) to do virtual backgrounds
on
Linux\footnote{in bioinformatics, many students use Linux instead of Windows or Apple's OSX, as it is more appropriate.},
and teams likewise does not support it on all platforms.

The simplest, most effective solution to this issue, while the ongoing
pandemic forces us online, is to simply not demand it, and seek out
alternative solutions. In the future we'll all be able to return to
classrooms, and this issue will not be present!

\hypertarget{neurodiversity}{%
\subsection{Neurodiversity}\label{neurodiversity}}

Some, neurodiverse (ND) students may not learn best while sitting still,
and be distracted by the social pressure to, or may not want classmates
to know they prefer to move around while following the
lecture\citep{duncan2021}, compared with their neurotypical (NT) peers.

Anecdotally, in my personal experiences within Bioinformatics (which I
teach) and Computer Science (a closely affiliated discipline), the
incidence rates of ND students is significantly higher than in other
fields, as the environments and jobs available often are very suited to
folks whose brains work differently (but just as well!) as the rest of
us.

\hypertarget{why-wont-they}{%
\subsection{Why won't they?}\label{why-wont-they}}

Students worry actively about things in their home, siblings, pets, or
their appearance being distracting .

\citep{10.1002/ece3.7123} surveyed students and found the following
reasons

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  I was concerned about my appearance {[}A, B{]}
\item
  I was concerned about other people being seen behind me {[}A{]}
\item
  I was concerned about my physical location being seen behind me {[}A,
  B{]}
\item
  I was concerned about distracting my classmates
\end{itemize}

Where A are things that affect under represented minorities more than
Cis/Het-White-Male students, and B are items that affect female students
more than male students. None of these are desirable feelings that
students should experience, and this concern is easily removed by not
requiring cameras.

\hypertarget{what-can-we-really-tell}{%
\subsection{What can we really tell?}\label{what-can-we-really-tell}}

When even teens are able to subvert the camera \citep{vice} and use
looped videos á la heist movies, the value of obsessing over this is
very suspect. It's not our job to police their behaviour, and even if we
try to, what can we really tell?

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{educase.jpg}
\caption{Example from \citep{educase} highlighting the sheer difficulty
in reading a student's body language}
\end{figure}

NT students and ND students may have a different appearance when
focusing as shown in the figure above, ND students may sometimes look
off into nowhere while listening hard, to avoid distraction. To an NT
teacher this looks like being ignored and can lead to negative
interactions \citep{Clouder2020-ux}. Determining what the student is
doing from their appearance is not an activity I wish to dedicate my
time to, discerning the body language of students and making uneducated
guesses at what their behaviour represents. I'd love for them to pay
attention, but they are adults, they will make their own choices.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

I think it's an extremely worthy goal, to understand how students feel,
but cameras are not the only way, nor the best given the potential
ethics, equity, and inclusion issues present in such a request.

For adults living on their own (e.g.~this course), it's a more
reasonable request. Adults working from home can be expected to have a
``home office'' or working space fit for camera. However for students
who are often living with family, I believe this is an unreasonable
demand made by far too many teachers, without considering the downsides,
nor what can actually be gained via this methodology or others.
