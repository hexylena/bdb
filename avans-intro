Q: Who are you, what program do you work for, what tasks do you have there?
A: My name is Helena and I work 2 days a week for ATGM in Avans and 3 days as a PhD Candidate in Erasmus MC. In Avans I am responsible for some systems administration, bioinformatics support, project mentorship, and teaching bioinformatics courses! The teaching is one of my favourite parts of the job next to developing high quality training materials for budding bioinformaticians.

Q: How do you see yourself, based on what is important to you, as a teacher?
A: Accessibility (from disabilities to simply having too many localised idioms in text) and inclusivity is one of the things I'm most passionate about as a teacher. I want to run a classroom which offers students ways to participate that work sufficiently for their learning preferences, and provide a welcoming space to everyone where students feel free to engage in dialogue with me over the structure of the lessons when they perceive inadequacies.

Q: Looking at the competences and learning objectives from the didactics module (see participant manual: what can you already do and what are your points for development?
A: I feel relatively confident in lecturing and supporting student learning and somewhat confident in designing single-day workshops, but designing full semester long courses and course design in general is definitely something I lack experience in and look to improve over this course.
