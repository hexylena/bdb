Phase 1: Describe the experience/situation you wish to reflect upon.

You can do this by using the STARR method: Situation-Task-Action-Result-Reflection

    What was the actual situation?
    What did I have to do in this situation?
    What action did I actually take?
    What was the outcome of this action?

Phase 2: Looking back: What exactly happened?

    What did I see?
    What did I do?
    What did I think?
    What did I feel?

Phase 3: Awareness of essential aspects

    What does that mean to me now?
    What is the problem (or the positive discovery)?
    What has all that caused? What does it involve?

Phase 4: Alternative methods

    What alternative methods do I see (solutions or ways of making use of what I have discovered)?
    What are their advantages and disadvantages?
    What will I remember for next time?

 Phase 5: Trial/action

    What do I want to achieve?
    What should I watch out for?
    What do I want to try out?
