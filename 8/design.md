1. Describe which points of attention in relation to the teacher-student relationship you want to work in the coming period (on the basis of received feedback and / or own insights).
2. Prepare a questionnaire for students (max 10 questions), the results of which can help you further in your role as supervisor / coach in relation to formulated points of attention. You determine the focus of the questionnaire yourself (which info will give you the most?).
3. Take the questionnaire with at least 10 students.
4. Process and describe the results and reflect on them via a reflection model of your choice.
5. Formulate action points: to what and how do you want to work in relation to the teacher-student relationship?
6. Submit a report of the above (1, 4 and 5) and the questionnaire (2) in your portfolio.

Points of attention

communication / availability
:  I know personally as a programmer I'm very comfortable with text-only communication, and need to make sure this matches up with my students or discover how I can communicate in a way that works for them. Additionally, due to the current situation and that I am still, often working from home, I want to make sure I'm available in ways that work for students.

participation
:  During online lessons in the past, I've had poor success getting students to engage in discussions, and I want to ensure an environment where you feel comfortable sharing or discussing out loud. What can I do to both motivate that and support students.


Questions:

1. How comfortable do you feel discussing course questions, issues, programming questions via:

   - emails
   - teams chat
   - video chat
   - in person meetings

2.
