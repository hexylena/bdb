","Helena wants to discuss my solution in front of the class, that makes me feel","Some of you have commented I go too quickly, how can we address this?",I feel like part of the class when _______,Any other remarks?,Are you getting the support you need? Do you have the resources you need?,Final remarks?
1,It's ok,My preferred way!,My preferred way!,"Yes, please",4,,It's fun,It's fun,It's fun,It's fun,"uncomfortable, because I have no prior knowlegde of programming and I don't know which commands exist or can be used in that particular situation. I know that my code won't work most of the time because of a lack of knowlegde and experience",Maybe repeat the taken steps so that it can be seen twice,answering questions in CoCalc together ,"Lessons are great, sometimes a bit too fast",4,Nothing else
2,It's ok,"Yes, please",My preferred way!,"Yes, please",1,,It's fun,Meh,It's fun,It's fun,"seen. As in they are not just skipping through the theoretical tidbit, but actually trying to see if the students understand it",In comp biology there was more space after each section to let everybody catch up. But i dont know if that is something that is possible with the programming course/if there is a lot more content to cover.,we go through questions and in the breakout rooms,I really think you are a great teacher already to be honest! Especially for these subjects as they can be very abstract to teach if your head doesnt relate to programming language easily,5,
3,My preferred way!,It's ok,My preferred way!,My preferred way!,2,,It's fun,It's fun,It's fun,It's fun,depends on the reason why but that usualy happens when an intresting problem came up that is usefull for the whole class to see and that is fine by me,This is most often a problem when tying in commands that we the students also have to use but then a lot of the time it is not clear when a command is needed for us to perform ore when you are just running it to explain something. A clarification before or repeating the steps that we have to perform could be usefull,we do excercizes and put the theory in to practice,,5,I am learning a lot and the lessons are engaging (I dont feel hinderd by the online format)
4,If I must,It's ok,My preferred way!,My preferred way!,1,,It's fun,Meh,It's fun,It's fun,"I am okay with it, everybody needs to learn. ",I think because everything is new and at the same time you try to keep up and do it yourself. It doesn't bother me to speak up to you if you need to slow down for me. But I don't want you to slow down only for me. knowing other people have the same issue helps,More people speak up. People need to be more interactive. Nobody responds when you ask a question. I am not always responding because I don't want to be the only one all the time. But I think it also can be frustrating for you that nobody is responding. ,"I found it difficult to do the assignments with you 1:1, because I don't understand the assignments immediately and sometimes can feel like I am to slow. It would have helped if I got a bit more time to try it myself and read the question I think. (The 1:1 itself doesn't bother me tho)",5,-
5,"Yes, please","Yes, please",My preferred way!,"Yes, please",2,,It's fun,Meh,It's fun,It's fun,"okey, most people struggle with the same problems so it is one to share the problems so everyone can learn","sometimes the needed codes go to quickly, or you make a mistake and have to go back and when you try to catch up it can be a little hard. But it is nice that the lessons are recorded so you can watch it back and pause where needed.",I can ask questions and we can get to that answers as a group,,4,
6,My preferred way!,"Yes, please","Yes, please","Yes, please",2,,It's fun,Meh,Meh,Meh,"Normal, totally fine","I have no problem with the speed, but maybe we can put it in the chat and than someone else speaks up?",Breakout rooms and going over mistakes,The lessons are quite useful,5,Easy to contact
