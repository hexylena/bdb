abstract: |
  As the pandemic continues and lessons continue online, my primary concern is
  that students are getting the support they need and feeling supported.
  Following the experiences during BDB and with finally beginning the period(s)
  during which I teach students, I've discovered a number of points which I
  should remind myself of regularly as preparation for each lesson.

# Points of Attention

Given that my lessons continue to be online, I find myself quite concerned about whether or not students are getting enough support and personal attention, and receiving it in ways that work optimally for them. I know that students can feel significantly isolated with working from home constantly, and that I want to ensure that I'm a friendly and accepting person that they feel comfortable contacting when they have issues. Specifically I've heard occasionally that I go too quickly and sought their suggestions for how to fix this--I don't notice it unless someone says it, and I'd rather they say it at the time it's happening.

# Questionnaire

I designed the enquÃªte to measure a couple aspects of this communication:

- Preferred method(s)
- Preferred interaction modalities
- Their experiences as students in my class
- And their feelings on my interactions with them until now.

These aspects I found to be particularly important to me and my interactions with students. I elaborated these with the following survey design:

Question | Aspect      | Text
---      | ---         | ---
1        | Question    | How comfortable do you feel discussing course questions, issues, programming questions via
1        | Description | Example questions include: where's the course recording, why is my code failing, what do you mean I need to import that first
1        | Answer      | A choice matrix of [Email, Teams Text Chat, Teams Video Chat, In person] and [Please no!, If I must, Meh, It's ok, Yes please, My preferred way!]
2        | Question    | I find online classes ....
2        | Description | 1 = They work great for me! 5 = It's so exhausted I hate it here
2        | Answer      | Likert-type scale (1-5)
3        | Question    | How do you feel about
3        | Answer      | Choice matrix of [Breakout rooms, being randomly called on, being predictably called on, Kahoots / Competitive quizzes] and feeling matrix of [Hate it, Meh, It's fun]
4        | Question    | Helena wants to discuss my solution in front of the class, that makes me feel

5        | Question    | Some of you have commented I go too quickly, how can we address this?
5        | Description | I'm guessing you don't want to publicly speak up? Would you want to message the TOA who can ask me to slow down? Is there something I can do to make you feel ok asking me to slow down in front of your peers? (I need the reminder, I get too focused on covering content, for sure.)

6        | Question    | I feel like part of the class when <blank>?
6        | Description | i.e. specific types of activities (and that I'm getting something more useful out of being here rather than doing chores or something else.)

## Results

![Students seem to be extremely comfortable with online communication, many just want to see a face clearly as video chat was rated even more highly than in-person meetings which is expected for my section of students as they were the half of the class which did not require in-person learning in a start of period survey.](./q1.png)

Question 2 students overall rated online classes as an ok experience (min=1, mean=2, max=4, sd=1), only one student gave a higher rating of 4 out of 5 (five being they're exhausted and hate it online), but this shows suboptimal study design as I've conflated "lack of enjoyment" and "exhaustion" which I expect many of us are experiencing, and it's unclear *why* the student responded like they did.

![This question answers an important point for me, that students are enjoying the new teaching methods implemented and discussed in Assignment 10, breakout rooms where they do pair-programming.](./q3.png)

Question 4's variety of responses have been interesting to say the least. To summarize the main points of the students:

- Some worried because they were beginners, and know that their answer won't be correct.
- Some feel very seen, that the teacher takes time to interact and discuss their answer.
- Most felt ok with it, knowing that it was a necessary part of the learning process.

Seeing these responses, and given that this is a technical course where we have a significant amount of control over where the students execute code, I've asked my TOA to look into automating the collection of student solutions to a given problem in a way that I can use it dynamically during class. That will allow me to discuss student solutions with the class anonymously and maybe achieve everyone's objectives: no hurt feelings, no uncomfortable attention, and the student's solutions we review will still feel seen.

Question 5 again gave food for thought on potential options to slow down, some more actionable than others

- All steps should be repeated twice.
- It's unclear when steps are something we need to run, or just for explanation.
- I don't want to slow down just for me, knowing other people have the same issue helps
- Sometimes you make a mistake, and catching up is tough, but the recording helps.
- No problem with speed.

Question 6 interrogated their community spirit, in case there was anything I could do to help there

- Answering questions together (x3)
- Breakout rooms & Exercises (x3)
- People speak up

I really appreciated the insight of one student's response there:

> People need to be more interactive. Nobody responds when you ask a question. [...] But I think it also can be frustrating for you that nobody is responding.

Which I have to concur with.

Question 7 had the most important point for me

- Lessons are great, sometimes a bit too fast
- I really think you are a great teacher already to be honest!
- I found it difficult to do the assignments with you 1:1, because I don't understand the assignments immediately and sometimes can feel like I am too slow.

That third point will be a focus of the reflection section below.

Question 8 showed students were absolutely getting the support they need (min=4, max=5, mean=4.666, stdev=0.47)

Question 9 was the other remarks section and not well responded to which is expected given that many people expressed opinions in 6.

## Reflection

- communications ok
- discuss problems with students
- students need to hear others having those same issues before they're comfortable speaking up
- difficult 1:1

4. Process and describe the results and reflect on them via a reflection model of your choice.


# Action Points

- Go through questions at the end of each exercise section.
- Go through student solutions anonymously and discuss common problems.
- Do not pair with students, the knowledge gap is too significant, instead have them form trios.

5. Formulate action points: to what and how do you want to work in relation to the teacher-student relationship?
