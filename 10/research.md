This study shows that a well-developed and accurate mental model directly
affects course performance and also increases self- efficacy, the other key
element in course performance. Given this double impact, helping students
develop good mental models should remain a goal in introductory programming
courses.
[...]
Apart from the programming language, the goal of building good mental models
could also be achieved by instruction that engages the student in experiential
learning tasks that involve tracing the logic of a program
[...]
Tasks such as debugging and modifying programs often involve tracing and are
likely to promote development of the mental model.

	Results across experiments were highly consistent: performance on both final tests was similar following provided examples and faded examples practice; however, provided examples took much less time to implement during practice. Therefore, considering both long-term learning and efficiency outcomes collectively for evaluating the effectiveness of learning techniques, provided examples continue to be more effective than techniques involving both provided examples and generated examples for learning declarative concepts.

	According to the empirical evidence, learning based on problem-solving may cause high-extraneous cognitive load for students who have limited prior knowledge, conversely learn based on worked example may cause high-extraneous cognitive load for students who have mastered the knowledge base. An alternative is a faded example consisting of the partly-completed task.

	It could, however, be shownthat fading is associated with fewer unproductive learning events and, thereby,lends itself to better learning outcomes.

	The results show a significant increase in both self-efficacy expectations and debugging performance in the experimental group in contrast to the control group. Therefore, our study provides empirical arguments for explicitly teaching debugging and simultaneously offers a hands-on approach for the classroom.

	Results showed that students in fact
	acquired a deeper conceptual understanding when they
	worked with the example-enriched tutor and they needed less
	learning time than in the standard Tutor.
