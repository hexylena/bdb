  After reviewing the reports from both Chen and Titia I've consolidated a couple of key situations which I would like to address, namely the lack of good pre- and post-class summaries and excessive apologising when a missing course component was discovered.

# Situation: Summaries

The start of the class featured a slide deck I'd created for the express purpose of introducing the topic to the audience. This included a couple bullet points of what we would cover, but it wasn't called out as a lesson plan, and it didn't include learning objectives. This should have been included as it would help learners identify the lesson contents and schedule and mentally prepare for the day.

## Looking Back

In an ideal lesson, these aspects would be covered sufficiently, and perhaps even I would have a checklist to go through before a lesson to ensure the presence of key components. However, I need to balance my perfectionism in this case, with the negative self talk that can result, and be measured in my evaluation of the situation, i.e. was it significant enough to warrant stress. In my ideal, every class is up to my standard of organisation because that's what I expect from others, and organisation is something I value quite highly.

## Awareness

This feels like a process failure to me, it was such a trivial part of the lesson to include that missing it feels like a significant oversight of something quite basic and easy to check for. By not being more careful, I miss the "low hanging fruit" of lesson preparation, I feel that I'm limiting my students in their education.

## Alternatives

A course day "checklist" I think would be an extremely valuable tool for me to develop for myself here. I use checklists in many other contexts to ensure I'm well prepared, this would be an ideal tool to leverage in the teaching context as well. It gives me an adaptable, interactive tool to make sure that all necessary elements are part of the day's plan. The primary disadvantage is ensuring that it's used consistently across lessons, a problem which will need to be explored during a trial.

## Trials

Before my next course, I plan to make a checklist and try going through it to see if it helps me achieve my desired level of preparedness and organisation for my courses. I want to try that out as a tool for ensuring lessons meet my standards and are useful to the students. I need to be careful that it actually gets used regularly, and I find a good way to integrate it in my workflow, maybe via regular calendar reminders.

# Situation: Apologies

During the start of the course, students needed to connect to a web service only available within the Avans network. EduVPN allows access to this service, but it was not included in the instructions despite that it should have been caught during review. I apologised repeatedly for this mistake since I felt responsible for missing it. In the end one of the TOAs directed them through installing and it was fine.

In this case an additional bit of information was not made public - that the lesson had not been on my calendar, it was officially assigned to a colleague, and I was not told I'd be teaching until the day before. I wrote the materials over 6 hours of testing and re-testing, but it did not have time to be reviewed by any colleagues before the lesson.

## Looking Back

I have high ideals for the success of lessons and this failure gives me strong negative feelings which puts me on the wrong footing at the start of a lesson. I value proper prior preparation.

## Awareness

Even though there were clear process failures leading up to this point, the excessive apologies were my own responsibility and could have been avoided, I don't need to take responsibility for group failures like that.

Especially when I'm able to handle similar technological failures and work around those (e.g. when my cocalc stopped loading temporarily), it is remarkable that I feel so much responsibility for missing this section of the materials.

## Alternatives

I saw some great examples from Titia during her courses, she was a really good role model here by acknowledging the issue without taking responsibility or apologising excessively. Even once is enough and then moving on to the resolution of the issue. The students know issues happen and don't care.

## Trials

While I don't desire to intentionally introduce a failure to force me to practice this situation, I at least know I should work on my self confidence with handling these teaching failures.
