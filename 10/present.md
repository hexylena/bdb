Hi I'm helena, my presentation covers specifically the introductory programming class which I teach.
I started her a year ago, and in the first year I didn't have latitude to update the materials so I saw firsthand the poor outcomes.
This year I've been workign to overhaul these materials and bring them in line with modern computer science education research.

The primary issue is that students have a poor working model of code, and that's a big problem. Ones mental model of a program underlies everything they will do with the code, understanding how it works, editing it, transforming it, integrating new modules, and of course debugging it when it goes wrong.

The course material already included formative assessments, these have been completely overhauled to use three new techniques in coordination with one another:

- tracing
- fading
- debugging

My hypothesis is that by improving the course materials with these new types of formative assessment, working in conjunction, students will have a sufficient mental model of the code that they will be able to work with it effectively.

We are already trialling pair programming to overall positive results, hopefully the introduction of these new activities will be met by similarly positive student responses. After thorough literature research, these were identified as some of the major factors we could easily affect without disrupting the curriculum or course objectives significantly. Literature has shown these to be effective strategies at improving student mental models with good downstream outcomes for students.
