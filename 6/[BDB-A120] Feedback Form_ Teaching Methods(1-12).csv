6	5	4	4	4	5	4	5	you're doing a great job. The breakout rooms are very nice. It is a nice way to work with the students and get some interaction and get to work with the theory. For me the theory stick better. 		
7	4	5	5	5	5	3	4	great lesson, it was a lot of information for one day but working on the excercises together helped a lot. bugs happen even to the best so no complains :)		
8	5	3	4	4	4	4	5	I think working in pairs in breakoutrooms really helped in solving some of the questions and getting some insight 		
9	4	5	5	5	5	4	5	I think it was nice to work on it together in breakout rooms, sometimes it was bit to fast to follow every steps, but still manageable. Also I really like how Helena approaches us and reacts when we ask a question. 		
10	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	The explanation was clear. All the topics were clearly covered. At times, it was perhaps a little too fast, which made it difficult to follow. The alternation between explanations and making assignments was good. 		
11	4	4	4	4	4	4	4	I liked the lesson, it was all still quite new so it was a lot of information for today. It was nice that there was some interaction so I could follow along with you to understand the process more. The explanation was clear and easy to follow.

Good mix between excersises and theory 

lessons/CoCalc needs to be tweeked a little bit, to make it more userfriendly and stable "		
13	4	4	5	4	3	3	5	I enjoy your way of teaching. You seem patient, and you make difficult subjects (like coding) sound very understandable.
