\begin{abstract}
Given the previously sub-optimal Python lesson which relied on students
individually completing assignments, a task with which they struggled
and felt quite isolated, here we discuss the replacement of individual
exercises with pair programming. This improved the lesson significantly,
with the additional improvement of teaching an industry-relevant skill;
pair programming is often used in the industry to decrease defects and
improve the onboarding process.

\hypertarget{pair-programming}{%
\section{Pair Programming}\label{pair-programming}}

Pair programming is a software development methodology requiring two
programmers to work together to solve problems and implement code.

\begin{quote}
One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,
reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch
roles frequently \citep{Williams}
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{sharing.png}
\caption{Screenshot of a teams call in which two students sit, one
actively working on writing code, the other leading the discussion. One
student's screen is showing CoCalc, a notebook platform where students
can type code and immediately evaluate it's correctness. This platform
allows us to write rich documentation, provide links to external
resources, and write exercise problems which students can then easily
work on individually or together.}
\end{figure}

Here we adapt this to the teaching environment via use of breakout rooms
with two students, and screen sharing permitting the same situation of a
``driver'' and a ``navigator''. This should reduce cognitive load and
frustration amongst students and allow them to rely on each other more
for technical discussions, rather than seeing the teacher as the primary
source of information \citep{Williams_2001}.

\hypertarget{positives}{%
\subsection{Positives}\label{positives}}

This methodology should hopefully bring significant improvements for
students as it has been empirically shown to be an effective learning
methodology for students
\citep{mendes2005investigating, mendes2006replicated}. Specifically this
technique has also been shown to be extremely beneficial for women in
computer science and gives them better chances for success in future
programming endeavours \citep{werner2004pair}, potentially by changing
the concept of programming from a solo activity to a collaborative
activity as it often exists in practice. Given that in business and
academia, programming often involves peer code review to ensure high
quality results, this makes it an ideal fit for our educational
practices and a very positive experimental change to make to classes.

\hypertarget{pitfalls}{%
\subsection{Pitfalls}\label{pitfalls}}

However there are some notable pair programming pitfalls in a teaching
environment, such as the student with more coding experience doing all
of the work by themselves
\citep{cliburn2003experiences, Williams_2002, mcdowell2003experimenting},
or students failing to swap roles leading to a similar result. These
issues can be mitigated through a number of methods including student
self-reporting their contributions or lecturers taking a supervisory
role \citep{Williams_2002}. \citet{Mentz_2008} additionally reports
success with the integration of the concepts of ``Cooperative Learning''
and provides guidelines for mitigating potential failure modes. These
can be addressed easily via teacher intervention and were done so during
the course, limited only by the availability of teacher and/or TOAs
moving between groups.

\hypertarget{feedback}{%
\subsection{Feedback}\label{feedback}}

Student feedback was extremely positive, averaging 4.35 for all
measures. The students overall liked the use of pair programming in
their learning environment and found that it invited them to actively
participate in the lesson.

They additionally provided comments on the above, filtered for
comments\footnote{The full response set is attached at the end.}
specifically concerning the aspect of pair programming:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \small ``The breakout rooms are very nice. It is a nice way to work
  with the students and get some interaction and get to work with the
  theory. For me the theory stick better.''
\item
  \small ``It was a lot of information for one day but working on the
  excercises together helped a lot''
\item
  \small ``I think working in pairs in breakoutrooms really helped in
  solving some of the questions and getting some insight''
\item
  \small ``I think it was nice to work on it together in breakout rooms,
  {[}\ldots{}{]}''
\item
  \small ``The alternation between explanations and making assignments
  was good.''
\item
  \small ``Good mix between excersises and theory''
\end{itemize}

Given the feedback it can be concluded that this was a successful
intervention and practice that should be continued throughout the rest
of the period. Additionally given that there are two sections of this
course, one taught by a teacher not employing this method, it will
provide an opportunity to further confirm or refute the success of the
experiment.

\hypertarget{do-and-donts}{%
\subsection{Do and Don'ts}\label{do-and-donts}}

This method is potentially not for every teacher, some teachers may want
more direct control over student learning but I've found it works well
for me personally, and after reflecting on the past weeks of
implementing this method. Additionally some Don'ts were unfortunately
discovered through personal experience\footnote{Student feedback noted
  that ``I found it difficult to do the assignments with you 1:1,
  because I don't understand the assignments immediately and sometimes
  can feel like I am to slow'' which makes me thankful I collected the
  feedback anonymously, they might not have supplied it otherwise.}.

\hypertarget{reflection}{%
\section{Reflection}\label{reflection}}

In this lesson a significant overhaul was made to the material to
function better as an online lesson. Further an intervention of pair
programming was applied via breakout rooms and pairing students off in
duos. I decided in the first breakout room to give students some privacy
and let them discuss together, while in the second round of breakout
rooms I ``walked around'' and visited the various breakout rooms to see
how students were getting on\footnote{This proved to be quite useful, I
  could see students making mistakes I would not have noticed otherwise,
  or if I'd only seen the final result.}. The breakout rooms went
successfully and students shared their results at the end. This is a
process I wish to automate in the future, sharing results back, in order
to give students some anonymity while I discuss common issues I saw
during their exercise. Here I could only comment on mistakes based on
their final result (if I did not observe) or the process if I was
present in the breakout room to see the specific error occur.

\hypertarget{looking-back}{%
\subsection{Looking Back}\label{looking-back}}

Overall this went quite well, I saw students interacting well and
switching off between roles but could not confirm the uniformity of
switching each time. I think this was a very successful intervention
based on my observations as a teacher and the reporting of the students.

\hypertarget{awareness}{%
\subsection{Awareness}\label{awareness}}

Based on the research included here, I think I need to further improve
my observation of the students, either transparently via the programming
environment we're using, or directly via my presence in the breakout
rooms. One of these options scales better, but it might leave students
without a good source of advice when they encounter difficulties in the
exercises. Whether this builds skills to overcome small challenges, or
leaves them struggling when they need assistance is yet to be seen.

\hypertarget{alternatives}{%
\subsection{Alternatives}\label{alternatives}}

Instead of pairing them in duos, I could try pairing them in threes but
this might lead to one person sitting back and not participating,
whereas the pair situation forces them to participate but doesn't risk
them feeling isolated. Next time I should continue my experiments of
whether or not to visit them in their individual breakout rooms during
the exercises to examine what effects that has on students, and
additionally survey them on their preferences to find a common solution
that achieves both my goals of a more supportive learning environment
while avoiding disrupting them or having them feel a stressful scenario
where they pressured to defend a topic they do not know well.

\hypertarget{trials}{%
\subsection{Trials}\label{trials}}

Given the results of \citet{werner2004pair}, women normally drop out of
computer science based activities at a very high rate, a rate which is
significantly decreased with pair-programming implemented. So, I'll be
carefully watching the outcomes of my course compared to my colleague's
to see how the women in my class feel compared to theirs, and if the
difference is significant to help them implement pair programming in
their class. However I need to be careful that I'm not blinded by the
success of this methodology on a global scale, and make sure I am
adapting to students who struggle with this model and prefer working on
their own, perhaps to be determined via further student surveying.
