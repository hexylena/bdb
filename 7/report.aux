\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces A screenshot from the slide deck covering assembly, this would be turned into an activity. Students would be split into three groups, each group with a different read length (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}k-mer), and each group would try and re-assemble the original text based on a pile of papers handed to them. This could be conducted with text in any language, even intentionally in a language students don't speak, to help them remove the effects of previous knowledge on solving the puzzle. One group would have 5-mers and would struggle, the other 7-mers and do better but still struggle with some repeats, and the last would have something longer like 15-mers to experience how that improves the process. The activity as written is equivalent to short and long read single-end sequencing, but we could use it as well to introduce paired-end sequencing, via another round of short-read sequencing but with paired-end results (i.e.\nobreakspace  {}5 letters, a gap of 10, another 5 letters as one piece of paper.)}}{3}{section*.5}\protected@file@percent }
